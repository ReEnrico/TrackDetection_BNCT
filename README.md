# TrackDetection_BNCT
Algorithms for blobs detection in gray-scale digital images
We will implement different track detection algorithms, spanning from thresholding to machine learning techniques.

## File hirarchy

Just a brief description for now

### img folder

Here we store training and test images containing blobs

### src

Here we store different python algorithms. The main characteristic of each function is that it gets an image in input and return an array of blobs (posizion, size ...) as output.
