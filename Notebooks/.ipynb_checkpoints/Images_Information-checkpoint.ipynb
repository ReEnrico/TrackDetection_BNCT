    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook contains an analysis of the images obtained from microscopic photographs of tissue samples into which boron has been injected and subsequently irradiated with thermal neutrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives are to identify the grey value distribution of the background and to obtain information on the characteristics of the blobs associated with the neutron tracks. \n",
    "To perform said operation a preliminary analysis was need, in which by means of the software VGG we have manually selected all the visible track to the naked eye.\n",
    "The selection operation consists of marking directly on the image with a circle the zone, the set of pixels, that we believe corresponds to a trace, the software automatically determines the diameter of the drawn circle and the position of its centre, as well as assigning a label to each selected region so that the information found can be neatly archived. As a result, we obtained a txt file for each image in which the coordinates (y, x, r) of each blob are marked.\n",
    "\n",
    "These collected data will be used for the operations that will be performed here."
